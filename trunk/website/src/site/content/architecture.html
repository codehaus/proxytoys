        <p>ProxyToys consists of two main components:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Proxy Factories</b></li>
            <li><b>Toy Factories</b></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Proxy Factories provide an independent way to create general proxy instances. The toys
        are factories for common problems solved with proxies (and themselves use Proxy Factories).</p>

        <!-- ************ -->

        <h1 id="factories">Proxy Factories</h1>

        <p>Whenever you have a need to create a dynamic proxy, you may use an implementation of the
        <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/ProxyFactory.html">ProxyFactory</a> instead depending
        directly on the proxy provided by the reflection API of the JDK.</p>

        <p>ProxyToys comes with two implementations of such a factory, one based on the reflection API
        of the JDK itself and the other one based on CGLIB. Each implementation has its own limitations and
        you might switch the proxy factory depending on the runtime environment as explained in the
        <a href="faq.html#Compatibility_CGLIB">FAQ</a>.</p>

        <p class="highlight">Always depend on
        <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/ProxyFactory.html">ProxyFactory</a> and select the
        implementation of your choice.</p>

        <p>Other bytecode manipulation libraries may be used to implement alternative ProxyFactory
        implementations as long as they can support or be used to build a compatible
        <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/Invoker.html">invoker interface</a>.</p>


        <!-- ************ -->

        <h1 id="toys">Toys</h1>

		<p>The toys exist as solutions for common problems solved with proxy instances. Some are build on
		top of another and you may derive your own specialized solution based on a available toy implementation.
		Each toy has a builder as proxy factory, that can be invoked to create a proxy for a single or for multiple
		types with a special assignment. the <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/pool/Pool.html">Pool</a>
		supports additionally normal constructors, because it is a normal object <em>using</em> proxies.</p>
		
		<p>Each toys utilizes a special implementation of an 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/Invoker.html">Invoker</a>, that is called for each method 
		invocation. In most toy implementations each proxy has its own Invoker instance. For very specialized
		proxies, you might use a different strategy though.</p>
