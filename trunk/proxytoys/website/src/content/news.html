	<h1><a name="20050928"><!--  --></a><b>Sep 28, 2005</b> ProxyToys improves Quality Assurance</h1>
      <p>ProxyToys uses now the 
      <a href="http://ci.codehaus.org/beetlejuice/viewProjectSummary.action?projectName=ProxyToys">Beetlejuice</a> 
      continuous integration plattform to ensure code quality in the Subversion repository. With the Beetlejuice installation
      at Codehaus every developer can quite immediatly see, if his changes affect the build of ProxyToys badly. Additionally
      the website has now a report for the unit tests. Both topics are linked in the menu of the project.</p>
      
    <h1><a name="20050905"><!--  --></a><b>Sep 5, 2005</b> ProxyToys 0.2.1 released</h1>
      <p>Announcement of the ProxyToys 0.2.1. The delegating toy had unfortunately a different
      delegation mode as default that could not be changed if also a specific ProxyFactory 
      implementation was used. This has been corrected and caused this maintenance release.</p>

    <h1><a name="20050904"><!--  --></a><b>Sep 4, 2005</b> ProxyToys 0.2 released</h1>
      <p>We proudly present our new release 0.2 of ProxyToys. ProxyToys
      delivers two intercheangable  Proxy factory implementations based on 
      JDK and CGLIB. It contains several solutions (toys) for standard use cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Decorators - for simple AOP-like chained method interception.</li>
        <li>Delegators - for delegating calls to different objects and supports implementation hiding.</li>
        <li>Dispatchers - for dispatching calls to objects with distinct interfaces.</li>
        <li>Echo proxy - for writing any call into a PrintStream before it is executed.</li>
        <li>Failover proxy - fails over to a next object in case of an exception.</li>
        <li>Hot swapping proxy - allows the exchange of the proxied object on the fly.</li>
        <li>Multicasting proxy - for multicasting a method invocation to multiple objects.</li>
        <li>Null objects - for default implementations of classes that do nothing.</li>
        <li>Pool - for a pool implementation that automatically collects unused instances again.</li>
      </ul>
