Have you ever developed code that uses java.lang.reflect.Proxy and thought:
"That Cglib library sure is cool. I wish I could leverage both standard proxies
and Cglib proxies without changing my code".

With ProxyToys you can! ProxyToys is to proxy generation what Jakarta Commons Logging
is to logging - an thin implementation neutral API for Proxy creation. Whether to use
Standard Proxies or CGLIB is a one-line code change.

Moreover, ProxyToys provides a collection of factories for creating "special" proxies
such as:

(Each one links to a new page with more detail and UML sequence diagrams)
o Null objects - for default implementations of classes that do nothing at all
o Multicasting objects - for multicasting a method invocation to multiple objects
o Hot swapping objects - allows implementation hiding that can be swapped, and mutual dependencies
o Failover objects - fails over to a next object in case of exception
o Decorators - for simple AOP-like chained method interception

ProxyToys is a compact library. If you choose not to use the CGLIB features it requires
no additional libraries.
