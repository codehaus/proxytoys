<h1>Compatability</h1>

<!-- ...................................................... -->
<h2><a name="Compatibility_JDK"><!--  --></a>Which JDK is required to
use ProxyToys?</h2>

<p>JDK 1.3 or later.</p>

<h2><a name="Compatibility_CGLIB"><!--  --></a>What are the advantages
of using CGLIB based factory over pure Java mode?</h2>

<h2><a name="Compatibility_CGLIB_Version"><!--  --></a>Which CGLIB
versions are compatible with ProxyToys?</h2>

<p>ProxyToys can run with CGLIB versions 2.1, 2.0.2 and 2.0. Note, that
the CLIB archives cglib-full-2.0.x contain also classes of <a
	href="http://asm.objectweb.org/">ASM 1.x</a>. The newer version ASM 2.x
is no longer compatible with any version of the plain CGLIB archives,
you may use therefore cglib-nodeps-2.1 instead.</p>

<!-- ...................................................... -->
<h2><a name="Compatibility_Others"><!--  --></a>Are there plans to
provide enhanced mode support to other byte code libraries?</h2>

<p>Yes. <a href="mailing-lists.html">Let us know</a> which library you
would like supported. Single precondition is an own Proxy
implementation.</p>


<!-- ****************************************************** -->
<h1>Scalability</h1>

<!-- ...................................................... -->
<h2><a name="Scalability_ThreadSafe"><!--  --></a>Is ProxyToys thread
safe?</h2>

<p>Yes. The Proxy factories have a static interface. Starting with
ProxyToys 0.2 none of the proxy instances itself created by the
individual toys do not have state.</p>


<!-- ****************************************************** -->
<h1>Development</h1>

<h2><a name="Development_Subversion"><!--  --></a>Why is the ProxyToys
source stored in a Subversion repository? What's wrong with CVS?</h2>

<p>The main reason for the use of <a
	href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> instead of CVS is
that the development for ProxyToys can take place while not connected to
the Internet. With Subversion, commands like add, remove, rename, diff
and revert do not require a connection to the server.</p>

<h2><a name="Development_FailingUnitTests"><!--  --></a>I run the unit
tests or ProxyToys in my IDE, but most of them are failing. Did you ever
run them?</h2>
<p>The unit tests are run with every build of ProxyToys. If your IDE has
collected the unit tests automatically, this might be wrong. You have to
call explicitly com.thoughtworks.proxy.AllTests.suite()</p>
