    <p>ProxyToys is not difficult. If you are familiar with the Proxy class of the JDK, then you already know how to
    use a ProxyFactory.</p>

    <h1 id="creation">Create a ProxyFactory and use it to create a proxy</h1>

    <p>See this simple example, that creates a <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/ProxyFactory.html">ProxyFactory</a>
    based on the JDK. We just hide the ArrayList instance behind the List interface:</p>

<div class="Source Java"><pre>ProxyFactory factory = new StandardProxyFactory();
List proxy = (List)factory.createProxy(new SimpleInvoker(new ArrayList()), List.class);
proxy.add("Hello World");
System.out.println("Size of list: " + proxy.size());
System.out.println("First element of list: " + proxy.get(0));</pre></div>

    <p><b>Note:</b> You can only use the methods of the List interface, to access the instance,
    methods like <code>java.lang.ArrayList.ensureCapacity(int)</code> are not accessible.</p>
    
    <p>Just replace the instance of the 
    <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/factory/StandardProxyFactory.html">StandardProxyFactory</a> 
    with <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/factory/CglibProxyFactory.html">CglibProxyFactory</a> to use a different
    implementation. You have to put the cglib-nodep-2.2.jar into your classpath though.</p>

    <h1 id="use">Using the toys</h1>

    <p>Each toy is a factory for proxy instances, that solve a common usage pattern of a proxy instance.
    Every toy has a factory with a builder interface:</p>

<div class="highlight"><code>&lt;Toy&gt;.proxy(...).build();</code></div>

    <p>As example see a usage of the <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toy/echo/Echoing.html">Echo</a> toy:</p>

<div class="Source Java"><pre>Map&lt;String, String&gt; map = Echoing.proxy(Map.class)
    .with(new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;())
    .to(new PrintWriter(System.out))
    .build();
map.put("hello", "world");
</pre></div>

    <p>This proxy is generated by a StandardproxyFactory, implements the Map interface and any call done to the 
    underlying object will be printed to <code>System.out</code>.</p>
    
    <p>Look at the different package descriptions of each toy. Everyone contains a description for the usage
    and examples.</p>
