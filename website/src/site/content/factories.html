		<h1>StandardProxyFactory</h1>

        <p>The <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/factory/StandardProxyFactory.html">StandardProxyFactory</a>
        is based on the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html">Proxy</a> class.
        With this implementation you can create proxies for interfaces. A single proxy may implement multiple
        interfaces as long all of them have disjunct methods i.e. no two interfaces may have a method with same name
        and argument, but different return types.</p>

        <h1>CglibProxyFactory</h1>

        <p>The <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/factory/CglibProxyFactory.html">CglibProxyFactory</a>is based on
        the <a href="http://cglib.sourceforge.net/">CGLIB</a> library. This factory has the same features as the
        StandardProxyFactory. Additionally it can proxy a real class unless it is not final. If the proxy instance
        implements multiple types, one of them can be a real class.</p>

		<p><b>Note:</b> A proxy for a real class will internally build by CGLIB as a subclass. Therefore you cannot
		create a proxy for such a type if the class is final. This is also the reason for the limitation of one real
		class in a set of types, that should be implemented by the proxy. An additional limitation exists for proxies
		based on a real class, since the <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/Invoker.html">invoker instance</a> is
		not called for final methods. Also the instantiation of such a proxy requires the initialization with the call
		to a constructor of the proxied base class. The CglibProxyFactory tries to stub the constructor arguments with 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/nullobject/Null.html">Null objects</a> if no constructor without
		arguments exist. This approach may fail in some cases.</p>
