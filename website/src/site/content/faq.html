<h2 id="Compatibility_JDK">Which JDK is required to use ProxyToys?</h2>

<p>JDK 5.0 or later, since the 1.0 release.  For JDK 1.4, please use ProxyToys 0.21</p>

<h2 id="Compatibility_CGLIB">What are the advantages of using CGLIB based factory over Java Reflection mode?</h2>

<h2 id="Compatibility_CGLIB_Version">Which CGLIB versions are compatible with ProxyToys?</h2>

<p>ProxyToys can run with CGLIB versions 2.2, 2.1, 2.0.2 and 2.0. Note, that the CLIB Java archives cglib-full-2.0.x
contain also classes of <a	href="http://asm.objectweb.org/">ASM 1.x</a>. The newer version ASM 2.x is no longer
compatible with any version of the plain CGLIB archives, you may use therefore cglib-nodep-2.2 instead.</p>
<p>Our Maven artifact has a transitive dependency on cglib-nodep-2.2, and we intend to keep up with releases of CGLIB going forward.</p>

<!-- ...................................................... -->
<h2 id="Compatibility_Others">Are there plans to provide enhanced mode support to other byte code libraries?</h2>

<p>Yes. <a href="mailing-lists.html">Let us know</a> which library you would like supported. The single precondition is that
    the library must have a proxy implementation.</p>

<h1 id="Scalability">Scalability</h1>

<!-- ...................................................... -->
<h2 id="Scalability_ThreadSafety">Is ProxyToys thread safe?</h2>

<p>Yes. The Proxy factories have a static builder interface. Starting with ProxyToys 0.2 none of the proxy instances
itself created by the individual toys do have any state.</p>

<h1 id="Development">Development</h1>

<h2 id="Development_FailingUnitTests">I run the unit tests or ProxyToys in my IDE, but most of them are failing. Did
you ever run them?</h2>
<p>The unit tests are run with every build of ProxyToys as our <a href="http://ci.codehaus.org/browse/PROXYTOYS">CI loop shows</a>. If your IDE collects unit tests automatically, this
might be wrong. Instead you have to call explicitly com.thoughtworks.proxy.AllTests.suite().</p>
